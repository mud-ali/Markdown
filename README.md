# Markdown parser

#### Intended to be a simple parser and converter from markdown to HTML
#### *obviously, this cannot be expected to be optimally efficient*

##### Currently added markdown features that work (to some extent)
- headings
- paragraphs
- bold text

###### and yes, the filename keeps track of how many times I've generated one of these ðŸ‘€

##### Stuff it's supposed to do (eventually): 
- Convert markdown into html
- allow customizable css stylesheets
- potentially convert into api endpoint at some point
